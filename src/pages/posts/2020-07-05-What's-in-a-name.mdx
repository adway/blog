# What's in a name?

A lot of thought and effort was put into choosing my name. Hours and hours were spent consulting Sanskrit and Marathi dictionaries and talking with family members to cross-check meanings.

At ages 30 and 34 respectively, my mother and father were budding engineers in their chosen career paths. My mother was an assistant professor on the tenure track at the University of Connecticut. My father worked in industry, at IBM. They didn’t necessarily value being the richest, but rather, the most hardworking and beneficial to the world. I would be their first child, and my parents wanted a name that would be reflective of what they hoped I would become.

After going through the entire Sanskrit dictionary many times over and ruling out names due to valid, yet funny idiosyncrasies—my mother wanted my name to begin with an “A” so that I would be at the front of the line if going by given names (my last name is “Wadekar”)—there were two choices left. “Advait” and “Adway”.

Now my parents ultimately chose the name Adway. According to them, the translation of the word in Sanskrit is “distinguished, like none other; unique”. Advait, according to them, means “non-duality or someone who has no enemy.” There are plenty more online Indian name dictionaries now than there were back in 2003, so I was easily able to cross-check these definitions.

A host of these dictionaries define both “Adway” and “Advait” as “unique”. But they further classify “Advait” as “unparalleled, or exclusive”. “Adway” on the other hand, also means “one, or united”. The definitions of the names seem slightly flip-flopped. If these dictionaries are correct interpretations of Sanskrit, then my parents chose the name for me which had the meaning that they did not want.

But the name they chose for me was perfect. “Adway” is not a common name by any means, even in India. “Advait” is the far more common name. Even people from my own Marathi community get confused and call me Advait. The name that was given to me is in and of itself “unique and like none other.”

My name truly suits my personality. Although my parents had hoped for me to become an excellent engineer, interested in nothing more than robots and circuits, I have chosen a different path. I’ve firmly believed for a long time that all subjects are intertwined in many ways. It’s no coincidence that Blaise Pascal and Renee Descartes were both mathematicians and philosophers. My interests have always been in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, but also in history, politics, economics, and literature. I’m not a single-track person, and I never was a single-track kid, as much as my parents thought I would inevitably be. I enjoy learning everything and forming connections between subjects in my brain. Studying a subject in isolation has never been my thing. In that sense, I operate under the principle that everything is “one, or united” just like my name suggests that my personality would be. My name fits my worldview, and well, that’s just pretty cool.

Mom and Dad: I understand why you chose the name “Adway”. You wanted me to be like no one else—a common sentiment among parents. But if the definition is not limited to what you thought it was, that is, if my name also means “one, and united”, you might’ve given me a name that is far more suited to my personality and hence far more meaningful and beautiful.
